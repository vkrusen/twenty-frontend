## CR line breaks found [Windows]

This is due to the line break characters of Windows and the git configuration. Try running:
```
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

Then delete the repository and clone it again.

## Extra yarn files 

If you have extra files created by yarn  (`yarn.lock`, `.yarnrc.yml`, `.yarn`), you may have a yarn version issue.
Try installing [yarn classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)!

## Missing metadata schema

During Twenty installation, you need to provision your postgres database with the right schemas, extensions, and users.
This documentation includes [different ways](/contributor/local-setup/yarn-setup#step-2-set-up-postgresql-database) to set up your postgres instance.

If you're successful in running this provisioning, you should have `default` and `metadata` schemas in your database.
If you don't, make sure you don't have more than one postgres instance running on your computer.
