In this document, you'll learn how to install the project using yarn. You should use this method since it's the easiest way to get started but you can also run the project with [Docker](/contributor/local-setup/docker-setup).  

:::info
`npm` does not support local packages well, opt for `yarn` instead.
:::

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Linux and MacOS" default>

Before you can install and use Twenty, make sure you install the following on your computer:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node v18](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 
- [yarn v4](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)

:::info Note
Yarn is now shipped with Node.js nowadays, so you don't need to install it separately.
You should only have to run `corepack enable` to enable Yarn if you haven't done it yet.
:::

<TabItem value="wsl" label="Windows (WSL)" >

1. Install WSL
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
wsl --install
```
You should now see a prompt to restart your computer. If not, restart it manually.

Upon restart, a powershell window will open and install Ubuntu. This may take up some time.
You'll see a prompt to create a username and password for your Ubuntu installation.

2. Install and configure git

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
```

3. Install Node.js, nvm, yarn
```bash
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
corepack enable
```
Close and reopen your terminal to start using nvm. 

:::caution Note

Avoid using Docker on WSL as it adds an extra layer of complexity.

## Step 1: Git Clone

In your terminal, run the following command. 

:::info Note

It's better to use SSH for this step. If you already haven't set up SSH keys, please do so first. You can learn more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh). 

:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ssh" label="SSH (Recommended)" default>

```bash
git clone git@github.com:twentyhq/twenty.git
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="https" label="HTTPS" >

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty.git
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Place yourself at the root of the project

```bash
cd twenty
```

All commands in the following steps should be run from the root of the project.


## Step 3: Set up PostgreSQL Database
You need to have a PostgreSQL instance available to be able to use Twenty.
You need to provision this database with a `twenty` user (password: `twenty`), a `default` database and a `test` database.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
<b>Option 1:</b> To provision your database locally:
```bash
make postgres-on-linux
```

<b>Option 2:</b> If you have docker installed:
```bash
make postgres-on-docker
```
This will create a Docker container, exposing a PostgresSQL instance at [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432).
You can access this using `twenty` postgres user (password: `twenty`)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac-os" label="Mac OS" default>

<b>Option 1:</b> To provision your database locally:
```bash
make postgres-on-macos-intel #for intel architecture
make postgres-on-macos-arm #for M1/M2/M3 architecture
```

<b>Option 2:</b> If you have docker installed:
```bash
make postgres-on-docker
```
This will create a Docker container, exposing a PostgresSQL instance at [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432).
You can access this using `twenty` postgres user (password: `twenty`)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="wsl" label="Windows (WSL)">

It's better to provision your database locally:
```bash
make postgres-on-linux
```
This will create a Docker container, exposing a PostgresSQL instance at [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432).
You can access this using `twenty` postgres user (password: `twenty`)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Step 4: Setup environment variables

Twenty requires you to set some environment variables. Locally, you should set them through a `.env` file.

To do so, make copies of the `.env.example` files in `/front` and `/server`:
```bash
cp ./packages/twenty-front/.env.example ./packages/twenty-front/.env
cp ./packages/twenty-server/.env.example ./packages/twenty-server/.env
```

## Step 5: Installing dependencies

:::info

Use `nvm` to install the correct `node` version. The `.nvmrc` ensures all contributors use the same version.

:::

To build Twenty server and seed some data into your database, run the following commands:
```bash
nvm install #recommended
nvm use #recommended

yarn
```

## Step 6: Running the project

Setup your database with the following command:
```bash
yarn nx database:init twenty-server
```

Start the server and the frontend:
```bash
yarn nx start:dev twenty-server
yarn nx start twenty-front
```

Twenty's server will be up and running at [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql).
Twenty's frontend will be running at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). Just login using the seeded demo account: `tim@apple.dev` (password: `Applecar2025`) to start using Twenty.
