Twenty primarily uses NestJS for the backend. 

Prisma was the first choice as the ORM with a lot of auto-generated code under the hood. But to offer users flexibility and allow them to create custom fields and custom objects, something more low-level than Prisma made more sense to have more fine-grained control. This is why the project now uses TypeORM. 

Here's what the tech stack now looks like.
