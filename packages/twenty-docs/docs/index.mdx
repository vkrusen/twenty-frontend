## Idea Behind Twenty
We’ve spent thousands of hours grappling with traditional CRMs like Pipedrive and Salesforce to align them with our business needs, only to end up frustrated—customizations are complex and the closed ecosystems of these platforms can feel restrictive.

The need for a CRM solution that empowers rather than constrains was clear, which inspired us to create Twenty. It's a next-generation open-source CRM that offers you the flexibility to shape it according to your business objectives and meet your team’s unique needs. Twenty is full of powerful features to give you full control and help you win more deals. 

## Getting started

There are three ways for you to get started with Twenty:
- **Cloud:** The fastest and easiest way to try the app (it's free)
- **Local:** If you're a developer and would like to experiment or contribute to the app
- **Self-hosting:** If you want greater control over your data and want to run the app on your own server

See the [Getting Started](./start/getting-started/) guide to learn more.
