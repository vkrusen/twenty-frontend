There are three ways for you to get started with Twenty:
### 1. Cloud

The easiest way to try the app is to sign up on [app.twenty.com](https://app.twenty.com).

The sign-up is free.

### 2. Local
If you're a developer and would like to experiment or contribute to the app, you can install Twenty on your local environment. Follow the [local setup](/contributor/local-setup) guide to get started.  

### 3. Self-hosting
You can also find [self-hosting options](/start/self-hosting) if you want greater control over your data and want to run the app on your own server. Right now, Docker containers are the only hosting option available, with more simple options to self-host Twenty coming soon.
