## Format Notes 

You can format your notes right from the editor. Use markdown syntax, press the `/` key or click on the `+` icon on the editor to see the different block options, such as headings, tables, and lists. You can also attach images to your note. 

Highlight the text to see more formatting options like bold, italics, and alignment options. 

You can also change the background color and text color of each block to highlight important things in your note. To do so, hover over the block you want to format and click on the `⋮⋮` icon besides the `+` icon. Click on <b>Colors</b> to open up all color options for both the text and the background.  

## Delete Notes

To delete a note, open it and click on the trashcan icon on the upper right of the screen. This will permanently delete your note.
