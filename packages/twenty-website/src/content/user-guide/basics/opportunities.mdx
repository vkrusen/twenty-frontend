All opportunities are presented in a Kanban board, where each column represents the stage of your workflow and each card represents a record. For each card, you can list the amount, close date, probability, and the point of contact. You can also move each card between stages as it goes through your workflow.

## Add and delete stages

You can add as many stages as you'd like to perfectly capture your entire workflow. To add a new stage, click on <b>Options</b> on the top right, choose <b>Stages</b>, and then click on `+ Add stage`. Name your stage and hit `Enter` to create it. Click on the name of the stage and then on on edit to change the stage's name and color.

To delete a stage, click on the stage name or on the `â‹®` icon that appears when you hover over a stage. Click on edit to open the menu and click on <b>Delete</b> at the bottom to permanently delete a stage. 

## Filter, update, and sort views 

It's easy to add filters and update your view to focus on only the most important things. To add a filter:
- Click <b>Filter</b> on the top right of the opportunities board and select the field you want to filter by (Amount, Close date, Company, Creation Date, Person, Pipeline Step, and Point of Contact).
- Select the filter's condition (is/is not, greater than/lesser than) and then choose the value of the field you want to filter by.
- You can either create a new view or update your current view with the filter in place. 
- You can also add another filter by following the same steps or clicking on the `+ Add filter` button on top of the columns. 
- To remove a filter condition, simply click on the <b>X</b> next to the attribute you used to filter the records.

You can also sort your records by Close date, Creation date, and Probability. To do so:
- Click on <b>Sort</b> on the top right. 
- Choose Ascending or Descending, and then the field you want to sort the records by. 
- You can then update your view or create a new one with the sort filter in place. 

## Display fields 

You can configure your kanban board to display some fields and hide others. By default, the Amount, Close date, Probability, and Point of Contact are all visible. To hide a field, click on <b>Options</b> on the top right, then on <b>Fields</b> to bring up the list of options. Hover over the field you want to hide to bring up the `-` button. Click on it to hide the field.  

You can also rearrange the order of fields by holding down the field name and dragging it to where you want it.
