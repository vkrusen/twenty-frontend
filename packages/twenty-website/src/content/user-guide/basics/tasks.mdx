You can find all the tasks from across your workspace in the <b>Tasks</b> window in your sidebar. You can also find a dedicated tab for Tasks on each record so you can add and edit tasks directly from each record. Alternatively, you can click on the `+` button on the top right of each record page and then click on <b>Task</b> to create a new task.

## Tasks page

Switch between upcoming and completed tasks to get an overview of what's pending and what's already been done. 

You can also see the tasks assigned to others by changing the assignee from the top right of the Tasks page, and edit each task to update the content, due dates, and assignee. You can also comment on each task.
