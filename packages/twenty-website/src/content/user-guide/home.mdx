The purpose of this user guide is to help you learn how you can use Twenty to build the CRM you want. 

## Quick Search 

You'll see a search bar at the top of your sidebar. You can also bring up the command bar with the `cmd`/`ctrl` + `k` shortcut to navigate through your workspace, and find people, companies, notes, and more. 

The command bar also supports other shortcuts for navigation.  

## Create Pre-filtered Views 

Twenty allows you to add filters to see data that meets certain criteria and hides the rest. You can apply multiple filters at once.

To create a filter in your workspace, click Filter at the top right and select the attribute you'd like to filter your records by. Create your filter and then save changes in a new view by clicking `+ Create view`. 

The filtered view is now available to your whole team.

## Add Stages For Opportunities

You can also add more stages to the opportunities board. 

On the <b>Opportunities</b> page, click on <b>Options</b>, <b>Stages</b>, then `+ Add Stage`.

You can also edit the stage by clicking on the name. 

## Create Notes and Tasks For Each Record

You can attach notes and tasks to each record. With Notes, you can keep a record of any observations, comments, and interactions, and keep track of all items that require action with Tasks. 

There are multiple ways to create notes and tasks. Learn more about [Notes](./basics/notes.mdx) and [Tasks](./basics/tasks.mdx). 

## Upload Files For Each Record 

You can also upload and attach files for each record. To do so, expand a record, and head over to the <b>Files</b> tab. You'll then see the `+ Add file` button.

Upload your file, match the columns, and validate the data to import it.
